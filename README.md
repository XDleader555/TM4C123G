# TM4C123G
Personal library for the TM4C123G microprocessor. Used in my CECS 346 class at long beach.
If you're looking at this for ideas, good on you. If you're copying my code, shame on you.

The goal of this library is to make development dead simple, similar to the Arduino IDE.
In fact, most of the functions will share the same names.
